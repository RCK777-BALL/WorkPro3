# Archived backend code

The `archives/backends` directory stores historical backend implementations that are no longer maintained. These folders are kept for reference only and should not be used for new development or CI runs.

- `backend-legacy/` – superseded Node backend kept for historical context.
- `backend/` – earlier mixed-case backend snapshot preserved for comparison and one-off audits.

All active backend work now lives in the `backend/` directory at the repository root. Update scripts and automations to target `backend/` instead of these archived copies.
