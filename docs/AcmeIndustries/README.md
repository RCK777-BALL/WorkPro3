# Acme Industries Departments

This directory acts as the company-wide root for departmental documentation. Each subfolder is dedicated to a single department, making it easier to organize process notes, onboarding checklists, and other reference material per team.

## Current departments

- [`operations/`](./operations/README.md) – Plant operations, shift procedures, and production scheduling guidelines.
- [`maintenance/`](./maintenance/README.md) – Preventive maintenance playbooks, asset care standards, and troubleshooting references.
- [`production/`](./production/README.md) – Line configurations, throughput goals, and quality checkpoints for each product family.

Add new subdirectories here as additional departments come online so all departmental resources remain grouped under the Acme Industries umbrella.
