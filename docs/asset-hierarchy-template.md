# Asset Hierarchy Import Template

Use the "Download Hierarchy Template" action on the Assets & Locations page to grab a ready-to-use CSV that can be opened in
Excel for bulk creating departments, lines, and stations that feed asset drop-downs. The CSV includes the following columns:

- **Department Name*** – required name of the department to add or update.
- **Department Notes (optional)** – free-form context about the department.
- **Line Name*** – required when defining a new line for a department.
- **Line Notes (optional)** – additional context for the line.
- **Station Name*** – required when defining a station on the line.
- **Station Number (optional)** – numeric or alphanumeric reference used on the shop floor.
- **Station Notes (optional)** – extra context about the station.

Example rows in the template illustrate how to complete the sheet before uploading it through the import flow.
