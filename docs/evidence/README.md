# Evidence Collection Guide

This folder stores command outputs or logs that prove each task was verified.

## Rules
- After each task, run the smallest relevant verification command.
- Save the output to `docs/evidence/<task-id>.log`.
- Include the command and output in the log.

## Example
```
$ npm run validate:env
...command output...
```
