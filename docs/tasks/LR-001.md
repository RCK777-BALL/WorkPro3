# LR-001 Ownership + scheduling + evidence tracking

## Goal
Establish ownership, due dates, and evidence tracking for launch readiness tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `docs/STATUS.md` exists and lists each LR/CP task with owner, due date, status, and evidence link.
- Evidence logging guidance exists at `docs/evidence/README.md`.

## Verification
```
ls docs/tasks
cat docs/STATUS.md
```

## Evidence
- `docs/evidence/LR-001.log`
