# LR-009 Production readiness must-have gaps

## Goal
Define and complete the logic/code work needed to close the must-have production readiness gaps spanning secrets/configuration, security hardening, reliability, observability, background job resilience, and offline readiness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Secrets and configuration hardening is implemented, including externalized secrets, required backend/frontend env var validation, and documented rotation/rollout steps.
- Security hardening is implemented (password policy enforcement, account lockouts, token rotation support, RBAC verification, and locked-down CORS origins) with evidence of configuration and tests.
- Reliability and data durability work is implemented, including backup workflows, migration execution/rollback documentation, and DB connection tuning with validation steps.
- Observability readiness is implemented with structured logging, Prometheus metrics exposure, and health endpoints (liveness/readiness) documented and verified.
- Background jobs resilience is implemented with distributed locks and lock TTL settings for schedulers/reminders, with runbook guidance and test evidence.
- Offline readiness is implemented with idempotency safeguards, conflict resolution strategy, and UI retry states documented and validated.
- Evidence is captured in `docs/evidence/LR-009.log`.
